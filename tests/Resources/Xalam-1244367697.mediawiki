'''Xalam''' (in [[Serer language|Serer]], khalam in [[Wolof language|Wolof]], and Mɔɣlo in [[Dagbani language|Dagbanli]]) is a traditional [[lute]] from [[West Africa]] with 1 to 5 strings.<ref name="TMOA">{{cite book |title= The Music of Africa |author= J. H. Kwabena Nketia |publisher= W. W. Norton and Company |place=New York |date= 1974 |pages=103, 258}}</ref> The xalam is commonly played in [[Mali]], [[Gambia]], [[Senegal]], [[Niger]], Northern [[Nigeria]], Northern [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mauritania]], and [[Western Sahara]]. The xalam and its variants are known by various names in other languages, including bappe, diassare, hoddu ([[Fula people|Pulaar]]), koliko ([[Gurunsi languages|Gurunsi]]), kologo ([[Frafra language|Frafra]]),<ref>{{cite web|last=Guttman|first=Yoav|title=What is a Kologo?|url=http://kologomusic.blogspot.de/p/what-is-kologo.html|access-date=2012-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043121/http://kologomusic.blogspot.de/p/what-is-kologo.html|archive-date=2016-03-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> komsa, [[kontigi]], [[Gurmi (lute)|gurmi]], [[Garaya (lute)|garaya]] ([[Hausa people|Hausa]]), koni, konting ([[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]), [[Molo (lute)|molo]] ([[Songhai people|Songhay]]/[[Zarma people|Zarma]]), ndere, [[ngoni (instrument)|ngoni]] ([[Bambara people|Bambara]]), and tidinit ([[Hassaniyya]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]]).

In Wolof, a person who plays the xalam is called a ''xalamkat'' (a word composed of the verbal form of xalam, meaning "to play the xalam", and the agentive suffix ''-kat'', thus meaning "one who xalams").
In Mande, this is ''ngonifola'' or ''konting fola''.
In Hausa, this is ''mai gurmi'' or ''mai kontigi''.

==Construction and tuning==
[[File:Diffa Niger Griot DSC 0177.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hausa people|Hausa]] [[Griot]] playing the [[Gurmi (lute)|gurmi]] (a Hausa variant of the xalam with a spherical body) in [[Diffa]], Niger.]]
The xalam, in its standard form, is a simple [[lute]] chordophone with one to five strings. The wooden body (soundbox) membranophone of the instrument is oval-shaped and covered with the hide of [[cattle]]. The strings of the xalam are typically made of two or three tightly wound strands of low-gauge [[nylon]] fishing line; these strings are fixed to the instrument's wooden neck by long and narrow [[leather]] strips and to its wooden bridge by cotton strings. By moving these strips, the instrument's tune can be adjusted. The xalam usually has two main melody strings that are fingered by the left hand (like the strings of a guitar or banjo) and two to three supplementary strings of fixed pitch. Most xalam players construct their own xalams, although they usually call on woodworkers (lawbe) to carve the body, neck, and bridge for them.{{cn|date=July 2022}}

In most Wolof-speaking parts of Senegal, the xalam has three principal tunings, all of which involve tuning the two main strings a perfect fourth apart. In the first tuning (''ci suuf'' or low), the main strings are tuned 1 and 4 ( 1 being the fundamental of a major scale), with three supplementary strings being tuned an octave higher to 1´, 2´, and 3´. The second tuning (''ci kow'' or high) uses the same string intervals but the fundamental is placed a minor second above the higher melody string, meaning that the open main strings now play the role of 3 and 6, with the supplementary strings acting as 3´ and 4#, the highest supplementary string usually being ignored. In the third tuning (''ardin''), the fundamental is a minor third above the lowest main string and the main strings are tuned 6 and 2, with supplementary strings tuned to 5 and 1´. The third supplementary string is either ignored or is tuned to 6 or 2´. If playing in an ensemble, the ''ardin'' xalam's main strings are tuned a minor third below the ''cu suuf'' xalam, and the ''ci kow'' xalam is tuned a major third above the ''ci suuf'' xalam to ensure that the fundamentals of each xalam coincide. (Thus, if the ''ci suuf'' xalam's lowest note were C, the ardins lowest note would be a low A and the ''ci kow'' xalam's lowest note would be E.){{cn|date=July 2022}}

In most areas the xalam is played by male [[griots]], or praise singers who are born into the profession. It most often acts as a solo or duo instrument to accompany praise songs and historical recitations, and in some areas it may form part of a larger group including kora, drums, and calabashes. It is traditionally heard at weddings, infant naming ceremonies, and (always with amplification) is now a common member of folklore ensembles, popular ''[[mbalax]]'' groups, and ''ndaga'' variety shows.
